=================
Posted code for Modelbuilder-0020, which is compatible with Processing 1.5.1. We will eventually migrate to Processing 2.0, but for now 1.5.1 is a more stable platform and many of the Modelbuilder examples have not been updated to be compatible.

Many examples require ControlP5 0.5.4 by Andreas Schlegel, which can be [downloaded from his repository](https://code.google.com/p/controlp5/downloads/detail?name=controlP5_0.5.4.zip&can=2&q=).
